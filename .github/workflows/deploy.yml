# TODO: Current implementation only triggers the deployment webhook.
# This could potentially lead to false-positive deployment statuses
# (in situations in which our tests succeed, but Amplify fails to deploy).
# A fix to it, could be deploying the app directly in this workflow,
# (the whole thing would fail on a failed push). However, that's a little bit
# undocumented & would probably require quite some research. I'm going to
# come back to this later.
