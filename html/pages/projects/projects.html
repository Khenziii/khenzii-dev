                Quick note: Please take into consideration that i'm just a hobbyist. I don't do this as a job. <strong>Only for fun</strong>, that's why <strong>most of my projects are not public</strong>. The bigger part of the stuff that i create is stuff that i make solely for myself and sometimes (kinda rarely actually) for friends. Don't worry tho, i also have a couple of things that i would like to share :). But before that, lets talk about my overall expernience - i have created stuff with:

                <span>
                    <ul class="list">
                        <li>
                            <img src="">
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <img src="">
                        </li>

                        <li>

                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </span>
            </p>

            <div class="project">
            
            </div>
        </main>
    </body>
</html>
