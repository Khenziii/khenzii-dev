                The first thing that i want to include on the list is my tiktokbot :) <br> <br> I have created it in <strong>2023 (have been coding it from June to July)</strong>. I have put a lot of effort into making the code as readable as possible =) Overall i'm really proud of that project and i'm really happy about how it turned out. You can checkout the repo below :>
