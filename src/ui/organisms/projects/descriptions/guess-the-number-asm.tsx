        {"Implementing a number guessing game (aka \"Higher Lower\") is a common learning exercise for beginner programmers. I did something similar, however in an old fashioned way. This projet was a helpful learning experience thanks to which I have a better understanding of all the commonly adopted software abstraction layers since the invention of computers. If you're on Linux, you can easily execute it yourself."}
